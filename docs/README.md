# KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure)

Documentation for the KERI protocol. Mostly markdown documents about implementation details. Eventually once we reach v1.0 we will use KIDs (Keri Implementation Docs) to document enhancements and changes. But until then we are just posting support and source documentation that is used to inform the IETF Internet Draft specificaiton for KERI
