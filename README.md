# Keri Community

## KERI Community Development Efforts

### Why Here? Why Now?

After some crucial conversations some painful, we have decided to resume the broader KERI development and standards process here under the auspices of the WebOfTrust GitHub repository. The work at DIF was initially fruitful but DIF's policy of not allowing individual contribution except under very narrow conditions became an impediment to the goals and aspirations of KERI to be the trust spanning layer for the Internet. That goal means contributions from any source with minimal friction. Specifically, an employee of an entity may not be an individual contributor at DIF unless their employer is a member of DIF. This prevented several would be contributors from contributing. Should DIF ever change that policy then we might reconsider re-engaging with DIF. Moving forward, we believe the IETF will proof itself to be a better home for KERI. Indeed the value statement and organizational principles of the IETF strongly resonate with KERI.
Quoting from [The Tao of IETF](https://www.ietf.org/about/participate/tao/), emphasis added.

>The IETF is a loosely self-organized group of people who contribute to the engineering and evolution of Internet technologies. It is the principal body engaged in the development of new Internet standard specifications. The IETF is unusual in that it exists as a collection of happenings, online and in-person, **in which individuals voluntarily participate. It has no members, and no dues;** see [RFC 3935](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3935), "A Mission Statement for the IETF", for more detail.
>
>Its mission includes the following:
>
>> + Identifying and proposing solutions to pressing operational and technical problems in the Internet  
>> + Specifying the development or usage of protocols and the near-term architecture to solve such technical problems for the Internet  
>> + Making recommendations to the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) regarding the standardization of protocols and protocol usage in the Internet  
>> + Facilitating technology transfer from the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) to the wider Internet community  
>> + Providing a forum for the exchange of information within the Internet community between vendors, users, researchers, agency contractors, operators, and network managers 
>>  
>The IETF mission further states that the Internet isn't value-neutral, and neither is the IETF. The IETF wants the Internet to be useful for communities that share our commitment to openness and fairness. The IETF embraces technical concepts such as decentralized control, edge-user empowerment and sharing of resources, because those concepts resonate with the core values of the IETF community. These concepts have little to do with the technology that's possible, and much to do with the technology that we choose to create.  

We always believed that the end state for KERI standards would be through IETF but were willing to incubate them in advance of the formal IETF RFC standards track process. We believe that there is no longer any need for incubation. The last few months, indeed weeks have seen the keripy implementation reach beta status including support for fully functional verifiable credentials. We believe that this has sufficiently informed KERI to propose an IETF Internet-Draft submission and hence this project WebOfTrust with associated repositories for both code and IETF Internet-Drafts.

## Meetings
We pressed pause on regular KERI meetings over the summer. We are now ready to resume with bi-weekly meetings. The meetings will be at 10 a.m. Eastern Time (EDT or EST depending on the season.
